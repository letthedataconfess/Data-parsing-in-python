"Restricting the Weak-Generative Capacity of Synchronous
Tree-Adjoining Grammars"
"
The formalism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars, a variant of
standard tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), was intended to allow the use
of TAGs for language transduction in addition to language
specification.  In previous work, the definition of the transduction
relation defined by a synchronous TAG was given by appeal to an
iterative rewriting process.  The rewriting definition of derivation
is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the
formalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not
impossible.
We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous
tree-adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard
tree-adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and
implementability problems of the original rewriting definition.  The
decrease in expressivity, which would otherwise make the method
unusable, is offset by the incorporation of an alternative definition
of standard tree-adjoining derivation, previously proposed for
completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to entertain
using the natural definition of synchronous derivation.  Nonetheless,
some remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the
definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed.  It
remains for future research to tune the exact requirements on the
allowable mappings.

The original definition of derivation for synchronous TAGs was based
on the iterative rewriting of one derived tree pair into another.  In
this section, we provide a more precise description of this approach
to derivation, along with a discussion of its problems.  First,
however, we digress to discuss some notational issues.
","
The notion of derivation just presented for synchronous TAGs is quite
nonstandard for the TAG literature in being ``flat'' and rewriting
oriented.  Recall that the standard definition of TAG derivation, due
to v87, is hierarchically structured in terms of derivation trees, trees that serve to characterize the operations
required to construct a particular derived tree, and hence its yield.
","
We show in this section that the natural definition of synchronous
derivation solves the two problems described in
 Section ","
Along with the advantages of the new definition of synchronous TAG
derivation, new problems are introduced as well.  First, the exclusion
of multiple adjunctions at a single address is problematic for
synchronous TAG derivations.  Second, the isomorphism requirement
between the derivation trees may be too strong as well.  The former
problem admits of a straightforward solution, which we describe below.
The latter does not; we describe the symptoms of the problem but leave
its resolution as an open issue for further research.

single node in an elementary tree.  The increased flexibility from the
ability to perform such multiple adjunctions makes it conceivable to
entertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation.
Nonetheless, some remaining problematic cases call for yet more
flexibility in the definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to
be relaxed.  It remains for future research to tune the exact
requirements on the allowable mappings.
